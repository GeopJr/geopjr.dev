whatido:
  - Ever since I can remember myself, I've always been fascinated with technology and eventually grew up on the internet.
  - Over the years, I started contributing a lot to open source projects as well as create my own, from custom Android ROMs & iOS jailbreak tweaks to fully client-side E2E encrypted text bins (see {{{GEOPJR_WORK}}}). Sometimes I do <a href="{{{GEOPJR_BLOG_SLUG}}}/how-i-hacked-an-anti-vaxxer-dating-and-bodily-fluid-marketplace-website">security research</a>.
  - I'm always up for a challenge and ready to research any piece of software in order to <a href="{{{GEOPJR_BLOG_SLUG}}}/svg-icons-an-eternal-quest">completely optimize it</a> or <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GeopJr/Tuba/issues/553">implement newfound design patterns</a>.
  - I've been a <a href="https://gnome.org/">GNOME</a> Foundation Member since 2020 and have contributed to many parts of the Linux desktop, first and third party libraries and applications. My research and experience often leads to <a href="{{{GEOPJR_BLOG_SLUG}}}">blog posts</a> &amp; <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKiLPm-Q7Lg">technical talks</a> for the wider community.
  - Moving forward I consciously choose to use the (limited) power I hold to ethically improve the lives of the people around me, fight climate change, protect activists and human rights and create accessible software for everyone.
